When we access a website, your browser will need to make requests to a web server for assets such as HTML, Images, and download the responses. Before that, you need to tell the browser specifically how and where to access these resources, this is where URLs will help.

**What is a URL? (Uniform Resource Locator)**  

If you’ve used the internet, you’ve used a URL before. A URL is predominantly an instruction on how to access a resource on the internet. The below image shows what a URL looks like with all of its features (it does not use all features in every request).

![A diagram showing different parts of a URL on an example, where http is the scheme, user:password is the user, tryhackme.com is a domain or the host, 80 is the port, view-room is the path, ?id=1 is the query string, and #task3 is the fragment. The full address is http://user:password@tryhackme.com:80/view-room?id=1#task3.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5c549500924ec576f953d9fc/room-content/34ad66d8b90aaaa35f9536d3b152ea97.png)  

**Scheme:** This instructs on what protocol to use for accessing the resource such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol).  

**User:** Some services require authentication to log in, you can put a username and password into the URL to log in.  

**Host:** The domain name or IP address of the server you wish to access.  

**Port:** The Port that you are going to connect to, usually 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS, but this can be hosted on any port between 1 - 65535.  

**Path:** The file name or location of the resource you are trying to access.  

**Query String:** Extra bits of information that can be sent to the requested path. For example, /blog?**id=1** would tell the blog path that you wish to receive the blog article with the id of 1.  

**Fragment:** This is a reference to a location on the actual page requested. This is commonly used for pages with long content and can have a certain part of the page directly linked to it, so it is viewable to the user as soon as they access the page.

**Making a Request**

It's possible to make a request to a web server with just one line "**GET / HTTP/1.1**"

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5c549500924ec576f953d9fc/room-content/09e70200e7af451077081a3ee3d3708c.png)  

But for a much richer web experience, you’ll need to send other data as well. This other data is sent in what is called headers, where headers contain extra information to give to the web server you’re communicating with, but we’ll go more into this in the Header task.  

**Example Request:  
**

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
Referer: https://tryhackme.com/
 
```

To breakdown each line of this request:  

**Line 1:** This request is sending the GET method ( more on this in the HTTP Methods task ), request the home page with / and telling the web server we are using HTTP protocol version 1.1.

**Line 2:** We tell the web server we want the website tryhackme.com  

**Line 3:** We tell the web server we are using the Firefox version 87 Browser  

**Line 4:** We are telling the web server that the web page that referred us to this one is [https://tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com/)

**Line 5:** HTTP requests always end with a blank line to inform the web server that the request has finished.  

**Example Response:**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:34:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 98

<html>
<head>
    <title>TryHackMe</title>
</head>
<body>
    Welcome To TryHackMe.com
</body>
</html>
```

To breakdown each line of the response:

**Line 1:** HTTP 1.1 is the version of the HTTP protocol the server is using and then followed by the HTTP Status Code in this case "200 Ok" which tells us the request has completed successfully.  

**Line 2:** This tells us the web server software and version number.  

**Line 3:** The current date, time and timezone of the web server.

**Line 4:** The Content-Type header tells the client what sort of information is going to be sent, such as HTML, images, videos, pdf, XML.  

**Line 5:** Content-Length tells the client how long the response is, this way we can confirm no data is missing.  

**Line 6:** HTTP response contains a blank line to confirm the end of the HTTP response.  

**Lines 7-14:** The information that has been requested, in this instance the homepage.


### Answer the following:

1) **What HTTP protocol is being used in the above example?**
	HTTP/1.1

2) **What response header tells the browser how much data to expect?**
	Content-Length
