## Learning Objectives

Upon the completion of this room, the user should gain a more in-depth understanding of XSS, in particular:

- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- DOM-based XSS
- How to protect against XSS

As already stated, XSS is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by another user. Consequently, they bypass the **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**; SOP is a security mechanism implemented in modern web browsers to prevent a malicious script on one web page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another page. SOP defines origin based on the protocol, hostname, and port. Consequently, a malicious ad cannot access data or manipulate the page or its functionality on another origin, such as an online shop or bank page. XSS dodges SOP as it is executing from the same origin.

## JavaScript for XSS

Basic knowledge of JavaScript is pivotal for understanding XSS exploits and adapting them to your needs. Knowing that XSS is a client-side attack that takes place on the target’s web browser, we should try our attacks on a browser similar to that of the target. It is worth noting that different browsers process certain code snippets differently. In other words, one exploit code might work against Google Chrome but not against Mozilla Firefox or Safari.

Suppose you want to experiment with some JavaScript code in your browser. In that case, you need to open the **Console** found under Web Developer Tools on Firefox, Developer Tools on Google Chrome, and Web Inspector on Safari. Alternatively, use the respective shortcuts:

- On Firefox, press Ctrl + Shift + K
- On Google Chrome, press Ctrl + Shift + J
- On Safari, press Command + Option + J

Let’s review and try some essential JavaScript functions:

- **Alert**: You can use the `alert()` function to display a JavaScript alert in a web browser. Try `alert(1)` or `alert('XSS')` (or `alert("XSS")`) to display an alert box with the number 1 or the text XSS.
- **Console log**: Similarly, you can display a value in the browser’s JavaScript console using `console.log()`. Try the following two examples in the console log: `console.log(1)` and `console.log("test text")` to display a number or a text string.
- **Encoding**: The JavaScript function `btoa("string")` encodes a string of binary data to create a base64-encoded ASCII string. This is useful to remove white space and special characters or encode other alphabets. The reverse function is `atob("base64_string")`.

Furthermore, you can experiment with displaying values, such as the `document.cookie` by using `alert(document.cookie)` for example.

## Types of XSS

To recap from the [Intro to Cross-site Scripting](https://tryhackme.com/room/xss) room, there are three main types of XSS:

- **Reflected XSS**: This attack relies on the user-controlled input reflected to the user. For instance, if you search for a particular term and the resulting page displays the term you searched for (**_reflected_**), the attacker would try to embed a malicious script within the search term.

- **Stored XSS**: This attack relies on the user input stored in the website’s database. For example, if users can write product reviews that are saved in a database (**_stored_**) and being displayed to other users, the attacker would try to insert a malicious script in their review so that it gets executed in the browsers of other users.

- **DOM-based XSS**: This attack exploits vulnerabilities within the Document Object Model (**DOM**) to manipulate existing page elements without needing to be reflected or stored on the server. This vulnerability is the least common among the three.
